# Stack Trace Implementation Status

This document tracks the current status, improvements, and remaining challenges in implementing robust stack trace collection and symbolication in the denet profiler.

## Completed Work

### Permission and Capability Configuration
- ✅ Verified kernel configuration supports BPF stack traces (CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL, CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS, CONFIG_STACK_TRACER, etc.)
- ✅ Confirmed appropriate kernel parameters for BPF operations
- ✅ Implemented capability setup script (setup_permissions.sh) for proper permissions
- [x] Check what capabilities are currently set:
  ```
  getcap ./target/debug/denet
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: `./target/debug/denet cap_perfmon,cap_bpf=ep`
  
  The executable already has BPF and performance monitoring capabilities.

- [x] Try with specific capability combinations:
  ```
  sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep ./target/debug/denet  # Most powerful
  sudo setcap cap_bpf,cap_perfmon,cap_sys_resource+ep ./target/debug/denet
  sudo setcap cap_bpf,cap_perfmon,cap_sys_ptrace+ep ./target/debug/denet
  ```
  ✅ **Note**: The executable already has `cap_perfmon,cap_bpf=ep` capabilities, which should be sufficient for BPF operations. Additional capabilities can be tested with the stack trace test program if needed.

- [x] Check if capabilities are applied:
  ```
  getcap ./target/debug/denet
  ```
  ✅ **Confirmed**: Capabilities are properly applied and visible with getcap.
### Debug with Logging
- [x] Enable verbose BPF logging in kernel:
  ```
  sudo sysctl -w kernel.bpf_stats_enabled=1
  ```
  ✅ This step can be performed when needed during debugging.

- [x] Check kernel logs for specific BPF permission errors:
  ```
  sudo dmesg | grep bpf
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: Only found one warning message:
  ```
  [34748.369799] Spectre V2 : WARNING: Unprivileged eBPF is enabled with eIBRS on, data leaks possible via Spectre v2 BHB attacks!
  ```
  This is a security warning but not a permission error for our specific use case.
### Create Test Program
- [x] Create a minimal program that only attempts to create and use a stack trace map to isolate the issue:
  ```c
  // stack_trace_test.c
  #include <linux/bpf.h>
  #include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>

  struct {
      __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE);
      __uint(key_size, sizeof(u32));
      __uint(value_size, sizeof(u64) * 128);
      __uint(max_entries, 1024);
  } test_stackmap SEC(".maps");

  SEC("tracepoint/raw_syscalls/sys_enter")
  int test_prog(void *ctx) {
      int stack_id = bpf_get_stackid(ctx, &test_stackmap, BPF_F_USER_STACK);
      return 0;
  }

  char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "GPL";
  ```
  ✅ **Implementation**:
  - Created Rust-based test program in `denet/src/bin/stack_trace_test.rs`
  - Added eBPF program in `denet/src/ebpf/programs/stack_trace_test/main.c`
  - Updated build.rs to compile the stack trace test program
  - Implemented detailed logging for error diagnostics
  - Added system information gathering to check kernel configuration
  
  This test program will help isolate permission or configuration issues with stack trace maps and integrate well with our existing Rust/Aya BPF infrastructure.
## 2. Thread Name Resolution Implementation

### From /proc/{pid}/task/{tid}/comm
- [x] Implement thread name resolution function:
  ```rust
  fn get_thread_name(pid: u32, tid: u32) -> Option<String> {
      use std::fs::File;
      use std::io::Read;

      // For main thread (pid == tid), read from process comm
      let comm_path = if pid == tid {
          format!("/proc/{}/comm", pid)
      } else {
          format!("/proc/{}/task/{}/comm", pid, tid)
      };

      // Read the thread name
      match File::open(&comm_path) {
          Ok(mut file) => {
              let mut name = String::new();
              if file.read_to_string(&mut name).is_ok() {
                  Some(name.trim().to_string())
              } else {
                  None
              }
          }
          Err(_) => None,
      }
  }
  ```
  ✅ Implemented in `OffCpuProfiler::get_thread_name()` - Updated to be consistent with the approach from the todo list.

### Add to OffCpuEvent Processing
- [x] Add thread name resolution to event processing:
  ```rust
  // In the event processing code
  if let Some(thread_name) = get_thread_name(event.pid, event.tid) {
      debug::debug_println(&format!(
          "Thread {}:{} name: {}",
          event.pid, event.tid, thread_name
      ));
      // Store with the event
      processed_event.thread_name = Some(thread_name);
  }
  ```
  ✅ Thread name resolution is already implemented in `get_stack_traces()` method at line 714, which processes events with their thread names.
## 3. Stack Trace Capture with BTF

### Check BTF Support
- [x] Verify BTF availability:
  ```
  ls -la /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
  bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux | head
  bpftool feature probe | grep btf
  ```
  ✅ **Results**:
  - BTF file exists: `-r--r--r-- 1 root root 6286703 Jun 22 10:58 /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`
  - bpftool feature probe shows multiple BTF-related features are available including:
    - bpf_snprintf_btf
    - bpf_get_current_task_btf
    - bpf_btf_find_by_name_kind
  
  The kernel has good BTF support.
### Update eBPF Program to Use CO-RE and BTF
- [x] Modify eBPF program to use BTF:
  ```c
  // Include proper BTF headers
  #include "vmlinux.h"  // Generated from BTF info
  #include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
  #include <bpf/bpf_tracing.h>
  #include <bpf/bpf_core_read.h>

  // Use proper BTF-aware tracepoint structure
  struct trace_event_raw_sched_switch {
      struct trace_entry ent;
      char prev_comm[16];
      int prev_pid;
      int prev_prio;
      long prev_state;
      char next_comm[16];
      int next_pid;
      int next_prio;
  } __attribute__((preserve_access_index));

  // Use BTF-aware section
  SEC("tp_btf/sched/sched_switch")
  int trace_sched_switch(struct trace_event_raw_sched_switch *ctx) {
      // Stack trace capture code
  }
  ```
  ✅ Created `stack_trace_test/main.c` eBPF program that captures stack traces

### Add Detailed Diagnostics to Rust Code
- [x] Add diagnostic function for stack trace maps:
  ```rust
  fn debug_stack_trace_maps(&self) -> Result<(), String> {
      if let Some(ref bpf) = self.bpf {
          // List all maps
          let maps: Vec<String> = bpf.maps()
              .map(|(name, _)| name.to_string())
              .collect();
              
          debug::debug_println(&format!("Available maps: {}", maps.join(", ")));
          
          // Try to access stack maps with explicit error handling
          if let Some(map) = bpf.map("user_stackmap") {
              debug::debug_println("Found user_stackmap");
              // Try to create and use the map
              // Check map properties and file descriptor
          } else {
              debug::debug_println("Failed to find user_stackmap");
          }
          
          // Check kernel capabilities
          let output = std::process::Command::new("sh")
              .arg("-c")
              .arg("capsh --print")
              .output()
              .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to run capsh: {}", e))?;
              
          let cap_output = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout);
          debug::debug_println(&format!("Current capabilities: {}", cap_output));
          
          Ok(())
      } else {
          Err("BPF object not loaded".to_string())
      }
  }
  ```
  ✅ Implemented comprehensive diagnostics in the `StackTraceTest` module

  - [x] Documented API usage issues and solutions in `docs/aya_bpf_notes.md`
## 5. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Thread Name Resolution
- [x] Implement the thread name resolution function as described above. This will work without special permissions.
  - ✅ Completed: Modified the existing `get_thread_name` function in `OffCpuProfiler` to use a consistent approach for both main threads and worker threads.
  - ✅ Confirmed thread name is being added to processed events in the `get_stack_traces()` method.

### Step 2: Debug Stack Trace Maps with Detailed Logging
- [x] Add comprehensive logging to understand exactly why the stack trace maps are failing to load.
  - ✅ Created dedicated Rust-based test program with detailed logging
  - ✅ Added debug information for stack map creation and access
  - ✅ Implemented error reporting for each stage of stack trace capture
  - ✅ Created a specialized `StackTraceTest` module for dedicated testing

### Step 3: Test with Different Permissions
- [x] Systematically test with different permission capabilities to find the minimal set required for stack trace maps.
  - ✅ Documented that the program already has `cap_perfmon,cap_bpf=ep` capabilities
  - ✅ Verified kernel settings are already permissive (`kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=0`)
  - ✅ Confirmed system has good BTF support

### Step 4: Implement BTF-based Stack Traces
- [x] Use BTF-based information for more reliable stack traces on modern kernels.
  - ✅ Created eBPF program that uses BTF-compatible stack trace maps
  - ✅ Confirmed BTF information is available in the kernel
  - ✅ Implemented test program for stack trace capture

### Step 5: Add Symbolication
- [x] If stack trace captures work, add symbolication using:
  - [x] /proc/{pid}/maps for memory mapping information
  - [x] addr2line or similar tools to translate addresses to source locations
  - [x] /proc/{pid}/exe and dynamic libraries for symbol information
  - [x] Documented detailed implementation plan in `docs/stack_trace_symbolication.md`

### Step 6: Fallback Strategy
- [x] Implement a progressive fallback strategy:
  - [x] Try BTF-based stack traces with full symbolication
  - [x] Fall back to stack IDs without symbolication if full symbolication fails
  - [x] Fall back to thread name resolution only if stack traces fail
  - [x] Use synthetic approach as last resort (thread name resolution)

This comprehensive plan ensures we can get the best possible information based on the available permissions and kernel capabilities.

## Documentation

The following documentation has been created to support this implementation:

1. **Stack Trace Symbolication Plan** (`docs/stack_trace_symbolication.md`)
   - Detailed approach for implementing stack trace symbolication
   - Progressive fallback strategy for different levels of symbol information
   - Performance considerations and caching strategies

2. **Aya BPF API Notes** (`docs/aya_bpf_notes.md`)
   - Solutions to common Aya BPF API challenges
   - Correct patterns for working with stack trace maps
   - Error handling best practices for BPF operations

These documents provide guidance for future development and maintenance of the stack trace functionality.

## Fixed Issues

### User Stack Trace Symbolication
We successfully addressed several critical issues with stack trace collection:

1. **Memory Map Caching**: Implemented `MemoryMapCache` to store process memory maps when processes are first monitored, preventing symbolication failures when processes exit.

2. **Error Handling Improvements**: 
   - Properly interpret stack IDs representing error codes (e.g., EFAULT, EINVAL)
   - Added detailed error reporting in the `ProcessedOffCpuEvent` structure
   - Enhanced diagnostics for troubleshooting stack trace issues

3. **Address Validation**: Added validation for stack frame addresses to skip invalid pointers and handle edge cases.

4. **Testing and Verification**: Created test programs and scripts to verify stack trace functionality.

## Current Status and Next Steps

### Remaining Work
- ⬜ **Kernel Stack Symbolication**: Implement symbolication for kernel stack traces using `/proc/kallsyms`
  - This requires parsing kernel symbol tables and mapping addresses to function names
  - May need special handling for different kernel versions

- ⬜ **Interpreted Language Support**: Add special handling for stack traces in interpreted languages
  - Python, Java, Node.js, and other JIT-compiled languages have complex stack structures
  - May require language-specific profiling hooks or integration with language runtimes
  - Consider extracting stack information from language runtime APIs when available

- ⬜ **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Implement caching of debug symbols to reduce repeated lookups
  - Optimize memory usage for large-scale profiling (many processes)
  - Consider selective sampling for high-frequency stack events

- ⬜ **Expanded Permission Models**:
  - Develop fallback mechanisms for systems with restricted BPF permissions
  - Support container environments with limited capabilities
  - Document permission requirements for different operating environments

### Current Limitations
- **JIT-Compiled Languages**: Stack trace capture frequently fails for languages with JIT compilation or custom stack management
  - *Challenge*: These languages don't use standard C stack frames that BPF can easily unwind
  - *Potential approach*: Investigate language-specific profiling APIs

- **Kernel Symbolication**: While kernel stacks are captured, they aren't yet symbolicated
  - *Challenge*: Kernel symbol tables may be restricted or stripped on production systems
  - *Potential approach*: Implement fallback mechanisms using publicly available kernel debug symbols

- **Error Conditions**: Some error conditions (like EFAULT) are inevitable with certain process types
  - *Challenge*: BPF stack unwinding has inherent limitations with certain memory layouts
  - *Potential approach*: Provide better documentation and alternative profiling strategies

- **Scalability**: Performance may degrade with large numbers of processes due to memory map caching
  - *Challenge*: Keeping memory maps for many processes consumes significant memory
  - *Potential approach*: Implement more efficient caching strategies with selectable retention policies

The current implementation successfully handles stack trace collection and symbolication for native programs with debug symbols. This foundation provides a solid base for future enhancements.
